      "Sean Murray promised there would be multiplayer but it would be very difficult to find one another. Soon after the game launched two streamers met up at the same place at the same time and could not see each other. The game is singleplayer. Sean has been very vague about everything since the begining and we're starting to know why. Above is a list showing the content that was planned and what is shown is an entirely different No Man's Sky. The game is not what they have promised and it not what was shown pre-launch or at E3. As you will read in many of the reviews, to many this game is not worth $60. No Man's Sky has a lot of good and can definitely be enjoyable. At it's core it is a great space exploration game that I could see myself enjoying for many more hours but the content that currently exists in the game is closer to $20-$30.\n",

      "The PC port is a complete mess that a very large amount of people have significant performance problems, including myself, such as very low FPS, significant stuttering and hitching, and dropping to less than a third of your average FPS after an hour of play until restarting the game. Many can't even play the game. The resolution option does not change the resolution as the in game resolution is a set sub 1080p resolution (nobody knows the exact resolution from what I can tell) and is upscaled. Every graphics option other than FPS limit and FOV require a restart. Some graphics features aren't changeable such as chromatic abberation, any LOD or view distance settings, ambient occlusion, and anisotropic filtering doesn't work. There are control bindings that don't exist for mouse and keyboard as well such as free cam as a pilot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The player count average has dropped from over 200,000 to about 30,000-50,000 within the first week of launch.

Secondly, if you are going to charge full price $60 for a product, it is reasonable to expect that product would have the content of a full priced game as well as work like one. Some say that the game is not complete and we should have known that going in. No Man's Sky released as a finished title for a full $60. A Full release is a full release will be treated like a full release. If you are considering buying No Man's Sky I encourage you to wait until either Hello Games gets their ♥♥♥♥ together or the community does it for them and pick it up at $30 or less price point.\n",

      "Before we start an angry mob I want to get something straight. I don't think we should start grabbing the pitchforks quite yet and I didn't make this review to make Sean Murray the devil. I come off a tad aggressive because yeah, they should be held accountable for their actions and it's pretty disappointing when something like this happens. However, I think it's very possible Sean and his team could have been in a very difficult situation where they really didn't have a right answer. He always seems anxious and stressed during interviews. Being in a 15 man team behind such an ambitious project with hype levels we haven't seen in awhile, partially because of Sony's marketing, it's understandable. It's also possible that when you invole a third party some power over the project is lost. Things are rarely black and white. Consider the situation on the other side of all of this before we go demonizing anyone. I think we should give No Man's Sky and Hello Games a few weeks to see where things go, see how they react to and handle the situation and let them show their true colors.\n",

      "So I never knew space was so boring.\n",
      "\n",
      "No man's Sky is a great idea that just never lived up to the hype. For the record I have had none of the technical issues that most players have had, and have around 10 hours on the game at writing this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem of the game is simply this. There is nothing epic in this game. No real reason to travel to the center of the universe, except to maybe see a cut scene or something similar hopefully making the game worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have had an hour in the game, mined some stuff, catalogged some animals, done some repairs to your ship, and flown into space, that is pretty much it. Gameplay is repetative and more then a little grindy. Everytime you take off your ship burns 25% of its total fuel. You fly usally less then 30 seconds, land near an unexplored point, (which are bland and unmemorable), click on the point, record that you found it, rinse, repeat. Then since the game is so much fun you need to tediously mine low grade minerals to fuel your ship, power your laser, and keep life support running. Which you need to keep doing because you consume a lot of resources. Then when you mine too much you get attacked by the sentinel ♥♥♥♥bots, because, you know, mining is so much fun they need to make the game more annoying.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a simple crafting system in the game that has done nothing to grab my attention. The ships are exactly alike in every way except the way they look and how much storage they have. If you didn't mind grinding constantly to keep supplied and liked the look of the first ship in game, there is literally no reason to upgrade otherwise. They manuever the same, they accelerate the same, they feel the same, just look a little different. Same with your multitool. All of them are exactly the same, except look, and storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly there are the alien races in the game. The ones that always stand in the same spots in their drab little settlements on every planet you visit are boring and have no real AI. The best part about them is that you can't understand them at all until you fly around to even more points, to go to ancient ruins and the such, to attempt to learn their language. One single word at a time. That's right kiddies, at 10 hours in, I have compiled somewhere around 50 words and still have no F'ing clue what they are talking about. Usually around the aliens are mathmatical puzzles to unlock items or to highlight yet another place for you to go to, which is fun right? No. These puzzles are usually noticing a pattern in numbers and could be solved easily by the average 2nd grader. Also where are the Alien cities or the like? The only thing that aliens do in this game is make you feel a little more insignificant, because actually you aren't discovering anything. You are just renaming stuff they apparently already found and are sitting on. Aliens on every world. That isn't exploring, its sightseeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly I guess I am just bitter. I really, really wanted to like this game. I wanted the feeling of epic adventure that we all dream would accompany exploration and space travel. The game just doesn't deliver. I will keep playing the game for a bit just to see if there is anything else waiting for me over the next dune, so to speak, but I am not confident anything will be over that horizon.\n",

      "Posted: August 14\n",
      "\"A mile wide but an inch deep\" was the title of Haedox's review, and a good one sentence summary of No Man's Sky. Since its release on PC, the amount of negative mobilization against the developer has been alarming, and overly harsh. However, behind the slandering and swinging punches there are some basic valid points. Two of which are that is was indeed released too early on PC, and it is overpriced. But for me, neither of these are why I'm not recommending the game at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main issue with the game is in its DNA. Whilst being procedural allows for everything to be different, this randomness is still limited by the depth of its algorithms. Visit 1 planet and you've essentially seen all 18 Quintillion - Colours, animations, flora and fauna may be randomized, but it all starts to look roughly the same. You start to see the parameters set by the algorithms - eg. placement of objects and resources, max terrain elevation. And this problem with depth is not just aesthetic, it affects the biological and geographic complexity and interactivity - extreme temperature shifts should be reflected in the flora and fauna, life should spring up around pockets of liquid on barren planets, a two ton dinosaur shouldnt walk on the hind legs of a bird. Whilst randomness may seem like a great way of creating a whole universe, the reality is our own universe is anything but random - rather a series of interconnected and relative processes. This is what makes it interesting to discover, and what is lacking in the NMS approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a game that relies on exploration as a key motivator to play, I just don't feel like I'm discovering anything spectacular or original. The first three hours of the game were fantastic. Good premise - ship has crashed, needs repair. A new alien world to discover - your time on the first planet is really brilliant - taking in excellent sound design, strange plants, spotting your first creature. However once you arrive at your second, third, and fourth, you start to realise that the game's main incentive - to discover new worlds, simply doesn't hold up under the weight of procedural limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interactions with aliens are entertainingly worded, but again, shallow and repetitive, as is resource collection and trade. These galactic duties are perhaps repetitive in reality, true, but where's the sense of danger in walking a few hundred meters to get that mineral, whilst the temperature is dropping 2 degrees a second? Where's the fear when you enter a planet's atmosphere, wondering if your ship will hold together? I can't really 'feel' that sense of exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are my criticisms, and something that I hope can be resolved. Sean Murray had the very best of intentions for our collective experience in NMS, I sincerely believe that. and you can see them throughout his creation - however, I can't help but feel that the game would have been more interesting if it wasn't entirely procedural - A single star system, where getting to your home planet was key - each planet uniquely different, with bordered 'maps' like Destiny, rich with unique plant life and atmosphere. As a discovery and exploration game, that would have been incredible. It makes me long to relive that first thrilling walk along the lonely coast of Dear Esther.\n",
      "\n",
      "So should you buy the game? I will say this, make an assessment based on what I've mentioned in this review, but regardless of your decision, consider that the small team responsible wanted to build the game that WE wanted NMS to be, and perhaps they'll get there. But regardless, respect has to be paid for dreaming and aiming big.\n",

I hope they patch and add so many other things (Like gas giant planets, ringed planets, different freakin' gravity levels for MOONS and different sized planets for the love of pete!). Gun/weapon modes? Three. PEWPEW bolt blaster, BZZZZZZZT mining laser, and KABOOM plasma grenades. That's it folks. And so far in my ship? two attack beams.l PEWPEW lasers and BZZZZZT mining laser.

Finding strange things in space and on planets IS fun and exciting, and I have enjoyed that aspect immensely, but this is space, and part of the selling points of the game are the huge variety of, well, everything --- but it's not the case.

All planetary outposts and space stations look the same. There is a very limited variety of NPCs, there is 3 different intelligent species you can interact with, the same 3 guys with different clothes basically, all NPC interactions are essentially the same.

The size of the games Steam download was already a dead giveaway at 2.5GB.

While you initially fooled me Hello Games with your less than direct marketing campaign (which sold exploration of an infinite galaxy and not infinite grind) your p.i.s.s poor PC optimization and constant crashes to desktop don't. While you are at it patch in an option that dials back all the survival and crafting nonsense and adds an option to just explore the galaxy because as it stands the game is completely hobbled by an inventory system that will require its players to have a degree in Inventory Management lest they lose their s.h.i.t completely. As far as crafting and survival games go this is just another to add to that long list that bore the s.h.i.t out of me. While I am certainly not that naive to not have expected there to be some degree of this kind of nonsense in the game, I wasn't expecting it to take center stage. And before the NMS Champions Brigade tries to take a dump all over me go watch the trailers on Steam again - they mostly sell exploration with a bit of combat and not the mining of 6000 quantities of Iron and Carbon or whatever-the-♥♥♥♥ for the one thousandth time to build X or recharge Y.

I planned on zooming around the galaxy naming planets, discovering fauna and flora and generally being the Darwinian of the games galaxy cataloging as many different types of animal species a planet or galaxy could throw at me until I started the game and my hopes of discovering and cataloging came crashing down around me as I was instructed to build X and repair Y by collecting components that run into the hundred's for many of the items you are required to build. I am not saying that having a survival aspect to the gameplay should be completely removed either, since it does add a level of authenticity and realism to the game, but I don't find it fun being continually reminded that my exoskeleton is being damaged thereby edging me closer towards death because I am not spending my time in grind mode mining for components that are supposed to keep me alive but instead indulging the discoverer in me. Fun immediately crushed! I didn't even get that far in to find out whether some flora or fauna are toxic or have medicinal or healing properties or whether some of the animal species have behavioral mechanisms, rendering some docile while making others more hostile or what their sustenance proclivities are and whether some are herbivores and other carnivores or omnivores who now see me as a possible potential food source.

This is not fun and smacks of an idea that sprung from the mind of a person that has never played a computer game in their life before. Either that or they realized how deathly dull all this resource gathering actually was and tried to spice things up a little.

I run a QA department for a large investment firm so I know all about the stress of delivering a quality assured product on time and on the date of release, but the fact you guys only hired a QA team after the PC launch was enough to tell me bugger all to no testing was done on the product - especially when it came to the PC build. How difficult can it be to get a number of systems together with different builds ranging from minimum to the recommended threshold and above and beyond that? No one is asking that you \"Procedurally generate\" PC builds to cater for every single type of possible spec out there, but surely amongst the team of 15 of you your home PC's all vary from spec to spec (some low range, others mid-range and possibly one or two of you sitting with high end PC gear)?

The game really is something special and unique, but in a world so massive and randomly generated, how can Hello Games allow No Man's Sky to become repetitive for the user to play?\n",
      "\n",
      "No Man's Sky works off the idea that you need to get to the center of your galaxy. It doesn't tell you how to do it, it just gives you a ship and a multi-tool to work with and away you go. This idea is actually a great concept, it allows the player to come up with their own story, their own objectives and make decisions on what to prioritise doing. So you eventually fix up your ship and you are starting your journey. Now, at the beginning, you are asked if you would like the help of the Atlas, which will allow you to then join the Atlas Path and collect Atlas Stones, which are used later on in the game, which for me, was my main priority. So from that point on I spent 20 hours going planet to planet, system to system, learning as much about the species that inhabited these worlds, while also building up to my goal collecting Atlas Stones and I was loving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then I got all the Atlas Stones I needed and it was laid out for me, get to the center. This was it, the final objective, the last task this game had for me. I crafted warp cell after warp cell, going through countless black holes in a race to get there before anyone else could. But by the time I travelled through 15 of these black holes, I had only travelled a tiny 15,000 light years, with a frustrating 160,000 to go. This is my main problem with No Man's Sky and Hello Games. They expect you to be okay going through over 150 black holes to reach the center of the galaxy, they think it's an acceptable game element to have, when quite frankly all it does is drive players away from playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where the repetition really hits in for you as a player. You just want to reach the center, you've done everything else, you've got a good ship, a large inventory and a great multi-tool, but that doesn't change the fact you need to grind all those warp cells to travel through 150+ black holes to reach a point you're starting to lose interest in. It kills me to slam this game because I've been enjoying my time with it so much and I love it, but this final act really does kick you in the teeth and is a disappointing end, to what is a great game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While Hello Games have crafted one of the most beautiful looking games I've played and how they've achieved what they've achieved with 15 people is astounding. But in turn, you've created a huge environment that makes the game feel so empty. This game needs more, give me tasks to do on the way to center of the galaxy, create new stones for different races, such as Gek Stones, just to keep us busy. This game is going to be updated and content will be added overtime, but I would strongly advise waiting until this game dips to around £20 before you pick it up. £40 is too steep for an asking price for what you get given in such a little time of play. While the game isn't a bad game, it just needs work. And with the right time and mindset, Hello Games can make No Man's Sky one of the most memorable games to ever grace the market.\n",

      "I'm gonna revoke my posetive/supportive review of this game. because its absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made it to the center of the galaxy. to do what? watch stars fly for 5 minutes and as i waited, MY GAME, resets to some \"game +\" just with my current ship and multitool....... are you serious????\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum this game up.\n",
      "\n",
      "10 first hours = the experience was amazing, i had this whole \"woooow\" feeling as i explored and had fun with the game...\n",
      "\n",
      "but after those 10 hours i got to relise, planets? its just basically reskins most of them, they look nearly exactly the same even closer to the center..... ANIMALS. a big one. MOST OF them look exactly the same or they have drastic changes. But what does it matter when... they all act the same, they eat the same, they behave the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "and to add to that, ALL the buildings in the game, from the 3-4 different factions.. have like wut? 3-4 different buildings which is just copied and pasted in all over the planets?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE GAME. is about EXPLORATION.... exploring the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again... is that fun to you?\n",
      "it even lacks in the exploration part cuz all you do is basically just rediscover, and see the same ♥♥♥♥ all over again...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And on top of that. sean murray the founder or whatever lied multiple times about the multiplayer aspect of the game, just to get it to the selling point, and then revoking that making it a singleplayer game before the release day..... Litterally this game will die out in less than half a year if they dont make some drastic changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cuz as it stands now the only way to make money is by farming on planets, griding for no purpose at all... BUT OH the game has a PIRATE SYSTEM. you get ABSOLUTELY nothing out of killing ships AND the combat system in the game, lacks majorily. Its not enjoyable at all. Theres not even a bounty system, so you cant deliver a \"kill\" to get some cash...\n",
      "\n",
      "I could go on and on. but the point is. The game is absolute garbage and boring as it stands now...\n",
      "they should have waited another year before releasing this 100%. such a scam\n",
      "Posted: August 16\n",
      "As for right now. It's impressive. The game is massive and nobody is going to explore it all by themselves. I've never tried harder to like a game in my life. I hopped on the hype train at their e3 trailer. I knew this game would be someting else, and it most defenitly was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sense of direction they've given you is very minor, almost non existant. You mine some stuff. get rid of some stuff to mine more stuff. Bring it to your ship and off you go to another planet. There's no building you can do, you can't inhabit a planet. You're lost. you have a ship and whatever you can find to survive.\n",

      "Good parts about this game, though.\n",
      "-Amazing soundtrack.\n",

      "Bad parts\n",
      "-Not for everyone\n",
      "- Hype train ruined what was supposed to be a small exploration game\n",
      "- Repetitive\n",
      "- Planets are re-skinned and the animals ARE NOT what you see in the trailer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all the game isn't bad, but isn't great. There are multiple games i would reccomend before No Mans Sky. This is also not worth the 60 dollars. 30 would be a reasonable price range.\n",
