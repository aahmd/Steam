Soon after the game launched two streamers met up at the same place at the same time and could not see each other. The game is singleplayer. Sean has been very vague about everything since the begining and we're starting to know why. Above is a list showing the content that was planned and what is shown is an entirely different No Man's Sky. The game is not what they have promised and it not what was shown pre-launch or at E3. As you will read in many of the reviews, to many this game is not worth $60. No Man's Sky has a lot of good and can definitely be enjoyable. At it's core it is a great space exploration game that I could see myself enjoying for many more hours but the content that currently exists in the game is closer to $20-$30.\",\n",

Many can't even play the game. The resolution option does not change the resolution as the in game resolution is a set sub 1080p resolution (nobody knows the exact resolution from what I can tell) and is upscaled. Every graphics option other than FPS limit and FOV require a restart. Some graphics features aren't changeable such as chromatic abberation, any LOD or view distance settings, ambient occlusion, and anisotropic filtering doesn't work.

A Full release is a full release will be treated like a full release. If you are considering buying No Man\\'s Sky I encourage you to wait until either Hello Games gets their \\u2665\\u2665\\u2665\\u2665 together or the community does it for them and pick it up at $30 or less price point.',\n",

I don't think we should start grabbing the pitchforks quite yet and I didn't make this review to make Sean Murray the devil. I come off a tad aggressive because yeah, they should be held accountable for their actions and it's pretty disappointing when something like this happens. However, I think it's very possible Sean and his team could have been in a very difficult situation where they really didn't have a right answer. He always seems anxious and stressed during interviews. Being in a 15 man team behind such an ambitious project with hype levels we haven't seen in awhile, partially because of Sony's marketing, it's understandable. It's also possible that when you invole a third party some power over the project is lost. Things are rarely black and white. Consider the situation on the other side of all of this before we go demonizing anyone. I think we should give No Man's Sky and Hello Games a few weeks to see where things go, see how they react to and handle the situation and let them show their true colors.\",\n",

You fly usally less then 30 seconds, land near an unexplored point, (which are bland and unmemorable), click on the point, record that you found it, rinse, repeat. Then since the game is so much fun you need to tediously mine low grade minerals to fuel your ship, power your laser, and keep life support running. Which you need to keep doing because you consume a lot of resources. Then when you mine too much you get attacked by the sentinel \\u2665\\u2665\\u2665\\u2665bots, because, you know, mining is so much fun they need to make the game more annoying.',\n",

The best part about them is that you can't understand them at all until you fly around to even more points, to go to ancient ruins and the such, to attempt to learn their language. One single word at a time. That's right kiddies, at 10 hours in, I have compiled somewhere around 50 words and still have no F'ing clue what they are talking about. Usually around the aliens are mathmatical puzzles to unlock items or to highlight yet another place for you to go to, which is fun right? No. These puzzles are usually noticing a pattern in numbers and could be solved easily by the average 2nd grader. Also where are the Alien cities or the like? The only thing that aliens do in this game is make you feel a little more insignificant, because actually you aren't discovering anything. You are just renaming stuff they apparently already found and are sitting on. Aliens on every world. That isn't exploring, its sightseeing.\",\n",

       "  u'\"A mile wide but an inch deep\" was the title of Haedox\\'s review, and a good one sentence summary of No Man\\'s Sky. Since its release on PC, the amount of negative mobilization against the developer has been alarming, and overly harsh. However, behind the slandering and swinging punches there are some basic valid points. Two of which are that is was indeed released too early on PC, and it is overpriced. But for me, neither of these are why I\\'m not recommending the game at this time.',\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"The main issue with the game is in its DNA. Whilst being procedural allows for everything to be different, this randomness is still limited by the depth of its algorithms. Visit 1 planet and you've essentially seen all 18 Quintillion - Colours, animations, flora and fauna may be randomized, but it all starts to look roughly the same. You start to see the parameters set by the algorithms - eg. placement of objects and resources, max terrain elevation. And this problem with depth is not just aesthetic, it affects the biological and geographic complexity and interactivity - extreme temperature shifts should be reflected in the flora and fauna, life should spring up around pockets of liquid on barren planets, a two ton dinosaur shouldnt walk on the hind legs of a bird. Whilst randomness may seem like a great way of creating a whole universe, the reality is our own universe is anything but random - rather a series of interconnected and relative processes. This is what makes it interesting to discover, and what is lacking in the NMS approach.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"For a game that relies on exploration as a key motivator to play, I just don't feel like I'm discovering anything spectacular or original. The first three hours of the game were fantastic. Good premise - ship has crashed, needs repair. A new alien world to discover - your time on the first planet is really brilliant - taking in excellent sound design, strange plants, spotting your first creature. However once you arrive at your second, third, and fourth, you start to realise that the game's main incentive - to discover new worlds, simply doesn't hold up under the weight of procedural limitations.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"The interactions with aliens are entertainingly worded, but again, shallow and repetitive, as is resource collection and trade. These galactic duties are perhaps repetitive in reality, true, but where's the sense of danger in walking a few hundred meters to get that mineral, whilst the temperature is dropping 2 degrees a second? Where's the fear when you enter a planet's atmosphere, wondering if your ship will hold together? I can't really 'feel' that sense of exploration.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"These are my criticisms, and something that I hope can be resolved. Sean Murray had the very best of intentions for our collective experience in NMS, I sincerely believe that. and you can see them throughout his creation - however, I can't help but feel that the game would have been more interesting if it wasn't entirely procedural - A single star system, where getting to your home planet was key - each planet uniquely different, with bordered 'maps' like Destiny, rich with unique plant life and atmosphere. As a discovery and exploration game, that would have been incredible. It makes me long to relive that first thrilling walk along the lonely coast of Dear Esther.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"So should you buy the game? I will say this, make an assessment based on what I've mentioned in this review, but regardless of your decision, consider that the small team responsible wanted to build the game that WE wanted NMS to be, and perhaps they'll get there. But regardless, respect has to be paid for dreaming and aiming big.\"],\n",

There is a reason they don't show that in the trailers and yup you guessed right Charlie Brown. Because that nonsense is tedious and doesn't sell games.\",\n",

       "  u\"I will admit I was quite excited for No Man's Sky. I planned on zooming around the galaxy naming planets, discovering fauna and flora and generally being the Darwinian of the games galaxy cataloging as many different types of animal species a planet or galaxy could throw at me until I started the game and my hopes of discovering and cataloging came crashing down around me as I was instructed to build X and repair Y by collecting components that run into the hundred's for many of the items you are required to build. I am not saying that having a survival aspect to the gameplay should be completely removed either, since it does add a level of authenticity and realism to the game, but I don't find it fun being continually reminded that my exoskeleton is being damaged thereby edging me closer towards death because I am not spending my time in grind mode mining for components that are supposed to keep me alive but instead indulging the discoverer in me. Fun immediately crushed! I didn't even get that far in to find out whether some flora or fauna are toxic or have medicinal or healing properties or whether some of the animal species have behavioral mechanisms, rendering some docile while making others more hostile or what their sustenance proclivities are and whether some are herbivores and other carnivores or omnivores who now see me as a possible potential food source. I think Jim Sterling summed it up perfectly when he described how he tried to jet propel himself onto the back of a creature and then fell right through it.

This is not fun and smacks of an idea that sprung from the mind of a person that has never played a computer game in their life before. Either that or they realized how deathly dull all this resource gathering actually was and tried to spice things up a little. Why does this surprise me though, since lately the design choices employed by the majority of the developers out there has me scratching my head and thinking that apart from being developers and creators are these people actually also gamers?

I run a QA department for a large investment firm so I know all about the stress of delivering a quality assured product on time and on the date of release, but the fact you guys only hired a QA team after the PC launch was enough to tell me bugger all to no testing was done on the product - especially when it came to the PC build. How difficult can it be to get a number of systems together with different builds ranging from minimum to the recommended threshold and above and beyond that? No one is asking that you \"Procedurally generate\" PC builds to cater for every single type of possible spec out there, but surely amongst the team of 15 of you your home PC\\'s all vary from spec to spec (some low range, others mid-range and possibly one or two of you sitting with high end PC gear)?

       "  u\"This game offers an experience like nothing I've ever played before. Endlessly going to new planets and star systems has been one hell of a ride and journey for me. These planets really do have real variety to them, I've seen so many different mixes of terrain, as well as the species. The game really is something special and unique, but in a world so massive and randomly generated, how can Hello Games allow No Man's Sky to become repetitive for the user to play?\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"No Man's Sky works off the idea that you need to get to the center of your galaxy. It doesn't tell you how to do it, it just gives you a ship and a multi-tool to work with and away you go. This idea is actually a great concept, it allows the player to come up with their own story, their own objectives and make decisions on what to prioritise doing. So you eventually fix up your ship and you are starting your journey. Now, at the beginning, you are asked if you would like the help of the Atlas, which will allow you to then join the Atlas Path and collect Atlas Stones, which are used later on in the game, which for me, was my main priority. So from that point on I spent 20 hours going planet to planet, system to system, learning as much about the species that inhabited these worlds, while also building up to my goal collecting Atlas Stones and I was loving it.\",\n",

       "  u\"But then I got all the Atlas Stones I needed and it was laid out for me, get to the center. This was it, the final objective, the last task this game had for me. I crafted warp cell after warp cell, going through countless black holes in a race to get there before anyone else could. But by the time I travelled through 15 of these black holes, I had only travelled a tiny 15,000 light years, with a frustrating 160,000 to go. This is my main problem with No Man's Sky and Hello Games. They expect you to be okay going through over 150 black holes to reach the center of the galaxy, they think it's an acceptable game element to have, when quite frankly all it does is drive players away from playing.\",\n",

You just want to reach the center, you've done everything else, you've got a good ship, a large inventory and a great multi-tool, but that doesn't change the fact you need to grind all those warp cells to travel through 150+ black holes to reach a point you're starting to lose interest in. It kills me to slam this game because I've been enjoying my time with it so much and I love it, but this final act really does kick you in the teeth and is a disappointing end, to what is a great game.\",\n",

This game needs more, give me tasks to do on the way to center of the galaxy, create new stones for different races, such as Gek Stones, just to keep us busy. This game is going to be updated and content will be added overtime, but I would strongly advise waiting until this game dips to around \\xa320 before you pick it up. \\xa340 is too steep for an asking price for what you get given in such a little time of play.

       "  u'My first computer was a Commodore 16, then a Spectrum 128 before I progressed to a Sega Mega Drive... the point is I\\'ve grown up on games that had to be smart about using memory and processing resources, and focus the content appropriately. That\\'s why you would see the same graphic or short motion video repeated in early games, with the excitement generated elsewhere. With today\\'s machines and consoles there is absolutely no excuse for seeing the same cut scenes over and over again, the same animations and reactions from the same alien over and over. The same building with the same layout just plonked down on a planet that never changes. I\\'m afraid they\\'ve procedurally generated some boredom! For those who followed the development of NMS with interest and were looking forward to it from a space-exploration perspective, these faults will be unbearable. But objectively, if you never heard of NMS and just bought it because it looked interesting and based on the write-up of what the game intends to be, you\\'ll be just as let down. I\\'m afraid the \"variety\" that you\\'re looking for isn\\'t here.',\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u'I\\'ve seen a few reviews that give NMS credit for \"realism\" in relation to the grinding nature of the planetary exploration experience. It\\'s solo space travel, it\\'s bound to be hard, right? Let\\'s kick that out the door right now. This isn\\'t a space-simulator, if it were, we\\'d all sit in our sub-lightspeed rockets and never get out of the galaxy. Basic elements of gameplay are just stupider than they need to be. These may be subjective, and others enjoy them, but personally I found the constant slot and resource management hugely negative. The fact that you don\\'t keep upgrades to your mining tool when you switch to a bigger one, the lack of a trade-in for your old spaceship are irritating too.',\n",

And the incidental things, like user interface and basic gameplay are unnecessarily fiddly. They must have spent a lot of man-hours writing the content of those tech updates (which in my view hugely over complicate the basic gameplay); time that would better have been spent on designing a more varied game-world.\",\n",

       "  u\"I really wanted No Man's Sky to be great, but first impressions (and the Jury is still out until I've given it more time), are that it isn't.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"After all the hype and lofty words from the publishers, the experience of playing NMS is disappointing and leaves me trying to work out what No Man's Sky is trying to be. For a pure game, there's considerably less character interaction & storyline driven gameplay than most users will be used to. Which is fine if it's just about the open universe and exploration, but in that case it needed to execute on the much vaunted 'variety' of the experiences that would be available to gamers (more on that below) and it simply doesn't. Moreover, it does seem to want to send me down a very defined path in relation to pursuing Atlas & gets a bit grumpy when I wander away from a planet before tracking down the lifesigns I need to find in order to trigger the next chapter.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u'I\\'ve played limited time so far, having basically \\'done\\' two planets & will happily eat these words if things change. But I have an uneasy feeling that I\\'ve discovered all there is of the gameplay and now have to repeat it ad infinitum across tons of similar (in terms of tasks and actions, not the procedurally generated variety) planets. While my two planets had differing environmental characteristics the gameplay is pretty similar on both. Grind your way around, resource gathering as you go, scan for signs of life and go and have the same conversation with the same alien (albeit with a different name each time), whilst trying to pick up the odd word from knowledge stones and encounters. In addition, a note of caution on the \\'variety\\' that the writers have been banging on about... both my planets have been unyieldingly boring and samey. Yes the worlds differ between themselves, but once you are on a planet, they never change. No regions of differing characteristics, mountainous, hot, cold, wet etc. They are toxic, everywhere, or wet, or cold or lush...everywhere. It actually feels like an incredibly lazy, algorithm-based way of giving the impression of a wide and varied universe whilst making the gameplay super dull. I guess If i consider the phrase \"procedurally generated\" in that context, it makes sense. I mean my bank statements are procedurally generated, but they aren\\'t very interesting! I\\'d rather have had 10 worlds to explore, that they had thought about and carefully designed to have variety from each other.',\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"Moreover, I get the sense that, while I can explore tons of planets (if I can get past the fact that the repeating landscape makes it very difficult to know where you are on a world in relation to where you've been -- why no map function???), if I want to 'progress', I'll need to tick off very specific points along a defined story path. In which case, this game feels to be neither an open universe to get entertainingly lost in, nor a particularly entertaining story-driven game. Other games, for example the GTA franchise have much more successfully combined strong story driven/mission based play with the capacity to just go off on your own and explore AND have fun. In fact maybe that's the crux right there... In trying to be all things the game has succeeded in mastering none. Each of us will be able to name 5 games that do one or two of the things NMS is trying to achieve, better than NMS.\",\n",

       "  u'I haven\\'t gone large on the fps issues and stuttering landscapes in this review, b/c I don\\'t judge them too harshly until they fail to fix the technical issues. It seems to be the way of the world to release games that aren\\'t ready and then patch them post-release. While it is true that, with all the lag and stuttering, I got a bit of \"Second Life\" deja vu (albeit without the variety brought by user generated content. And w/o meeting anybody else of course), but my bigger fear is that the really fatal issues with this game are not patchable, because it\\'s fundamental concept execution stuff - it\\'s just a poorly executed game. In fact, I suspect we will come to reflect that the hubbub about technical problems on release probably saved the publishers a fairly savage critical backlash early on, which would have been much more disastrous for sales.',\n",

       "  u'First, while I was installing this game I went to the store page on steam and began reading the reviews. I was immediately let down to see so many people having problems with crashes and horrendous lag. I was utterly let down and was expecting a horrible experience. I was surprised to find that I had the exact opposite. So far during my two hours of gameplay on my Radeon R9 200 Series, I have been playing on high graphics with a steady 60 FPS with zero crashed. The game has run beautifully and I had a blast frolicking amongst the new flora and fauna I discovered on my starting planet. I highly recommend to anyone considering purchasing this game to make sure your computer specs SURPASS the recommended hardware for this game. A lot of people have been having issues running this game at its full potential, and perhaps I am a one in a million case, but I find that very hard to believe. ;)',\n",

During the entire development this game the developers have been saying that this is not a game for everyone. This game is not a Star Citizen, it is not a city builder, and it is not an FPS. This game is built for a group of people (like myself) that have a very particular taste that is unsated. This game fills a hole in a very niche genre that hasn't ever been explored before. So I highly encourage you to watch full gameplay and developer interview to get a full grasp on what this game is meant to be.

As Sean Murray says in the article I link above, \"This maybe isn\\u2019t the game you *imagined* from those trailers. If you hoped for things like pvp multiplayer or city building, piloting freighters, or building civilizations\\u2026 that isn\\u2019t what NMS is. Over time it might become some of those things through updates.\\u201d He later explains that through future updates, they will add in new features like freighters and base building. But currently this game is purely made for exploration purposes. And last but not least, you have to understand that this is uncharted territory in the gaming world, and the fact that with such a small team, that this studio put together a game of this scale is just staggering. In conclusion, PLEASE do your research and make sure that this title is a fit for you and your PC. This game is not for everyone, it isn\\'t even for most people, but if it is for you, I guarantee you will enjoy it.',\n",

In total, I wound up playing for over 27 hours, but the last 12 hours felt so painful, and incredibly tedious. Progress to the centre feels too slow and underwhelming, and I am not even close to getting there. The game has a lot of content, but lacks purpose, and gets repetitive.

Around the 25 hour mark I started to notice just how repetitive the game is, not in what you do, as I always knew that was the case. However the planets were all the same. Every planet class has certain materials you\\u2019ll find on it, and those materials won't be found on another planet of a different class, even if it has the same characteristics of that other planet.. Ex: Planet X is cold, it has Element X in abundance, however Planet Y is inhabited by hostile sentinels, it has Element Y in abundance, Planet Z is cold, and inhabited by hostile sentinels, it has neither Element X nor Element Y, instead it has Element Z, which is found on all planets. That\\u2019s not me just being unlucky, In my 30 hours I\\u2019ve gone to 19 star systems and over 50 planets. This along with the massive list of features shown in the trailers which simply aren't in the game has made me realize that me wanting to like this game made me blind to the obvious issues that plague the experience for me.\",\n",

       "  u\"First off, I would like to thank everyone who took the time to comment on my review. Everything said has been hilarious at best and interesting at worst. I've never had a review \\u201cexplode\\u201d like this before, so this is been kinda cool for me.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"Anyways, a few further thoughts in response to other people's thoughts.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"On the topic of the game not running/being bugged/bad port, I haven't experience this myself. I have an Intel i5-4590, nVidia GTX 970, and 12 GB RAM and I'm running the game 1920x1080, anti-aliasing OFF, anisotropic filtering 2, texture/shadow/generation/reflection all HIGH, and max FPS 30. With those specs/settings the game literally runs just fine for me. I've experienced no crashes and no bugs. Every now and then the game will hang up a second or two went I arrive somewhere new, but that's it for me. This has been a non-issue for me personally. I cannot comment on that aspect further.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"As for missing gameplay features...this is also more of a non-issue for me personally. I personally don't care if I can see other people in the universe or not. I expected this game to be solitary, so it was what I expected. Aside from multiplayer features, I don't really know what else everyone is saying is lacking from the final release. I did not closely follow the pre-release buzz (because I was going to get this game anyways), so I am not informed as to what else was promised that is not present.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u'Concerns about repetition in relation to limited content and procedural generation are valid. True, the pool of parts the algorithms can pick from is rather tiny indeed. Many planets have a tendency to feel samey overall, and I would say that this is the weakest aspect of the game. However, I personally am willing to accept this limitation as a trade off for the game existing in the first place. I bushed along this this topic in the review above, but I will elaborate a little further: Exploring places that feel similar is a bad thing, yes, but I do not find this to be the focus. The focus is more abstract. I feel this game is more about exploration ITSELF rather than the results of the exploration.',\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"Arguments about resource management I would say are half valid. From my experience so far, the resource gather is more \\u201cat your pace\\u201d than \\u201cat the game's pace.\\u201d If I want to sit around on a Moon mining gold and gathering a big reserve of Plutonium, I can. If I just want to grab enough fuel to hop to the next system, I can do that too. Your \\u201cday-to-day\\u201d resource requirements in the game are very low. You can easily get upgraded ships and multi-tools just by exploring and without ever mining for resources to sell. Even warp cells require very small amounts of resources. (50 Carbon, 100 Plutonium, 50 Heridium, 50 Zinc, and 100 Thamium9 in total if you make it from scratch. For reference, your suit's inventory slots have a maximum stack size of 250.) And with just a few upgrades to the multi-tool, mining is very fast. Furthermore, this game is secondarily a survival game, and resource management is an important aspect of survival gameplay. I do not see any problem with the resource system in game, since I feel like this is exactly what would happen in the world of No Man's Sky: decentralized harvesting/production of goods due to extremely advanced technology that allows individuals to be nomads and just grab elements they need to manufacture goods they need directly.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"In close, I am still enjoying this game, and I anticipate any aspects will be fixed and expanded upon within the coming months. That said, if Hello Games DOESN'T get the PC port better optimized, then at least half the criticism leveled at them will be totally valid. Also, if they don't add more content, then I will certainly be disappointed. I do agree that $60 feels steep for a game \\u201ca mile wide and an inch deep,\\u201d but I myself personally paid full price as an way of \\u201cpaying forward\\u201d further development and because I was very excited for an exploration game that veered more into hard sci-fi.\"],\n",

More resources so you can afford more upgrades. Some resources are so abundant as to be meaningless, and others are so haphazardly distributed that it's either glut or famine.

Early on, space pirates are pretty much the only way you could die (I never died in this game) because they can pile up pretty quickly and your initial ship will suck at fighting back (more on ships later).

This game was originally advertised as a multiplayer game or at least according to what todd howard's disciple had told us. It no longer is though which sucks because that one feature would have made this game so much better than it currently is, even if the universe is so large that statistically there was very little chance of ever meeting anyone it would have been the feeling of knowing you could meet someone that would have made this so much better and more worth its price (but yet again who knows maybe the developers will do the smart thing and add multiplayer to this game to make it that much better in the future) I don't believe that the game is currently worth the big $60 I believe it could have been worth that if it had multiplayer in it but it doesn't, So I reccomendwaiting for a sale where it gets to about 50% off as then this game would truly be worth it.\",\n",

       "  u'',\n",

       "  u'Gameplay The gameplay in no mans sky is extremly repettitve each planet you come across(thier are millions) are extremly similar and slightly different from each other, some of them are cold some of them are hot some of them are poisonous but every single one of them is extremly boring to explore because the game offers little to no motivation to explore each planet because every time you do it is almost the same exact thing as the last planet exept it looks different. Anouther element of the gamplay in no mans sky is the aliens which you cant understand a damn word there sayimg until you learn their language. So i thought ok fair enoogh ill learn their language then. And then it hits you about three hours into playing no mans sky i have learned almost 250 alien words yet i still have no idea what the aliens are are saying, great so you clearly need to learn an absurd amount of words just to understand a sentance of what they are saying which i really dont feel like learning a thousand words so then i can maybe understand what the aliens are saying. Some People may like this but i dont i simply dont have enough time in the day to go to hunderds of planets to learn alien words maybe some people do but i dont. The second part of gameplay that annoys me is the stupidly small inventory space that you start the game with it simply is not enough space to carry all of the items that you need. I have been told you can upgrade this later but what does later mean 10 hours? 20 hours? 50 hours? This is where i realized no mans sky is a massive grind. You collect resources like a mad man you run around planets for technology you upgrade your ship, then after hours of grinding maybe the game will be as fun as the e3 gamplay looked like it would be',\n",

The game was delayed twice and in my opinion the game was rushed to meet a deadline. The game runs terribly, the game has reppetitive gameplay and no multiplayer (that we were promised by sean murray) so in conclusion no mans sky is a 3 out of 10. It would be a fun game if it was a 20 or maybe even 30 dollar indie game but was hyped up to be a 60 dollar full price triple A release, when it simply isnt. So in conclusion im just disappointed that this game was so hyped up and, it just ended up being anouther typical run of the mill space survival game.'],\n",

Everything in NMS needs fuel or maintenance, in one form or another. . There are various elements (Carbon, Iron, Iridium, Plutonium, etc.) that must be mined using your upgradable Multi-tool (gun) which satisfy these requirements, mostly exosuit (survival)/starship operations. These elements have a rarity index, and are also used to craft technology from discovered blueprints. Although survival, crafting, and maintenance isn\\u2019t very difficult or worrisome later on, many people will find this aspect a major drag, especially in the early stages of exploration when inventory management is really tedious.

This warp cell requires antimatter, electron vapor, and suspension fluid recipes, along with all intermediary and base elements required to craft those objects. Although warp cells/intermediate ingredients can be randomly awarded, making a warp cell each time is a massive turn off.

There is a lot of pop-in textures and on-the-spot rendering which truly detracts from the immersion, and the variety of textures and assets themselves are low enough to count.

Starting worlds are sometimes boring but you can easily spend dozens of hours combing them for whatever resources or making up little missions for yourself; if this game cost $9.99, or had it not forcibly sodomized an entire incoming class of high school freshmen on the first day of school, it surely would have gotten an overwhelmingly positive reception.\",\n",

The solar systems are static, meaning the planets don't actually move (orbit, nor rotate). Sean arrogantly scoffed at the notion of sky boxes and fake day/night cycles, saying his game will be different. Well thats exactly how he built the game, sky boxes and fake day/night cycles. All of the explanations about planets orbiting their stars and rotating on their axes to provide day and night were lies to peak your interest. This game uses the same technique to make day/night cycles as every other.. SKY BOXES!! FAKE SUNS!! YAY!! He talked of sophisticated mechanics that determined what type of planet it would be depending on how close or far it was from the star. Where elemets would be present on those planets because of their postion in the solar system. All elements are found on all planets, it doesn't matter how far or close you are to the sun to determine a hot or cold planet. Its just random, not procedural. There isn't even a true star in the system, just a fixed point of light which can never be reached. Sean Murray is a millionaire because of us buying his lies. ALL of the major features that he was hyping for the last year are not in the game.. 2/10, would shove down Sean Murray's throat if I could.\"],\n",

       "  u'If I had to describe my thoughts and feelings about NMS so far, then it would be: COGNITIVE DISSONANCE. I really feel torn between loving the game and being disappointed. After following the entire hype, trying out NMS, to me, somehow feels like waking up from the ultimate sex dream, then forgetting most of the hot, nasty details in the blink of an eye and then realizing that the weather outside is really horrible and that I\\'m late for work. That same heavy, bleak, emptiness in my chest haunts me now that I paid 60 smelly euros for this piece of seemingly unfinished or kidnapped-by-big-corporations \"indie game\". To be clear, it isn\\'t as much about the money (although it most definitely is) as much as it is about the whole trust issue in regards to Hello Games and everything about this game\\'s release. I cannot help but feel somehow cheated. It didn\\'t help not having ever read the steam refund policies. Before NMS, I never even thought about asking for a refund so I had never read the rules and conditions that would make one eligible for a refund. It simply never even crossed my mind to read through that stuff, which was definitely my mistake. If stupid me had known about the specifics of the refund policy, I\\'d requested a refund well within the first 2 hours and bought Doom, or the new Deus-Ex or Mafia instead. I was almost 8 hours into the game when I decided that I definitely wanted my money back, because No Man\\'s Sky is seriously not worth 59,99\\u20ac as it is now. Maybe 19.99\\u20ac, tops. I have to admit, the first 8 hours went by fast, but it was slow at the same time due to the slow gameplay and low framerate. Judging by youtube videos of the PS4 version and players on high end PCs, the game seems to be running pretty smoothly and the gameplay generally seems fast enough (movement etc). Compared to those videos and live streams, the game looks like it\\'s running on half-speed on my end which I only realized a bit later after trying to see how the game behaves on other players\\' PCs.',\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"My graphics card seems to be bottlenecking my PC (geforce gtx 650, i5-3570K 3,4GHz, 16GB RAM) so I'm playing NMS on the lowest possible settings with a painfully low framerate and, as I mentioned, gameplay that seems heavily slowed down when compared to ps4 or footages from uber-high end PCs. Simply put, I definitely think that No Man's Sky is not worth 59,99\\u20ac as it is now. Since I can't get a refund, I'll be saving up some money for a new graphics card (for new AAA games, not NMS). Hopefully, there'll be some cool, free updates to NMS by the time I upgrade. Otherwise, this would be the worst way I've ever spent 60\\u20ac, which is actually twice as much money where I live. EDIT: I'd love to give the game a try on better graphics settings and with a smoother gameplay on my end, since I do feel that I could chill out nicely with this. Still overpriced.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"I played NMS only twice since launch (launched the second time after refund requests were denied), but each time I spent about 7 hours losing myself in the game, which is how I expected it to be. It's easy to kill a few hours without even realizing it and even easier to forget about everything else (real life BS) just by exploring, mining and some flying. For me personally at least. There is a lot I like about the game, maybe it's just the idea of what it could have been or maybe it's the chillout factor which cannot be denied and I quite enjoy. However, I find it so freakishly hard to really pinpoint what it is that would deem this game good, or bad. And that's something that's really bugging me. Although I enjoyed what I've experienced so far (to some extent), I cannot ignore all the bad feels that've gotten into me due to all the little intricacies and details surrounding Hello Games and what they had promised compared to what they delivered. In a weird way, the game feels unfinished. And the whole way they develop/reveal the lore/story aspect just feels poorly executed and unimaginative. I think that NMS would have been much better off with some RPG-inspired quests that would dive deeper into the lore of the different in-game races etc. Hello could learn a lot from e.g. Fallout New Vegas on how to keep a player interested in the lore and the little details, while still being able to just mindlessly wander around and collect and build stuff. But I get it, NMS was never intended to be such a game and I'm fine with it. Still, NMS feels like an underachiever. Also, each time I check the latest news and rumors about NMS, I feel even worse because I really couldn't wait to be amazed and I really was prepared to love and enjoy every single aspect of it.\",\n",

Planets, whether they\\'ve got animal life or not, all play the same stock audio loop of animal noises for some reason. Every planet (that I\\'ve seen in my 60+ hours) has the same hilly terrain, plus or minus a few cosmetic differences.

They\\'re not nerfed just for the sake of artificial challenge, which is a refreshing change from the norm. The NPCs, ships, and multitools do look very different from one another in the majority of cases, even if they are often functionally identical. And spaceship flight might be badly botched in its implimentation, but it definitely does something that it sets out to do - facilitate borderless travel between planets.

       "  u\"Everything about this game was a lie. The environmental complexity and the graphics don't even match the level presented in the trailers. The devs promised this seamless experience where you would run into other players if you happened to be on the same planet, it can't even do that much; even if it was a feature it wouldn't function well seeing how no one can even connect to the game servers. The truth is the game doesn't tell you how to do anything, and no I'm not one of those wimpy gamers that expect to be told in game how to solve each problem, but when it comes to a basic mechanic like crafting I'd rather not spend 30 minutes with a keyboard and a lot of menus trying to figure out what key to press when the menu could display it. What's happened to gaming? Even in the 80's games did a better job directing the player in the most basic of directions when it came to mechanics, but it's something so easily over or under done with modern games. Save stations are scattered throughout each planet when the devs promised there would be seamless auto saves to ensure that the illusion that you were in a seamless world would never wander. I tell you save often because this is yet another game where devs thought they could release a unoptimized 60 dollar game for PC players and get away with it, random crashes await (NEVER MINIMIZE THE GAME FROM FULL SCREEN, IT WON'T MAXIMIZE!). I have a gtx 970, with an amd 8350 stock clocked, awesome cooling, and 8 gigs with ddr 3 clocked at 1600MhZ and I was getting 7-10 fps for the first 10 minutes, then it went up to 40-60 sporadically. The technology behind this game is remarkable on server side but client side not enough is actually being processed to warrent such low fps on such a crazy system, PS4's are dropping less often than on pc with this game.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"But this is a game about exploration and that is what they have been promising in this game since 2011, that's where my expectations have and still are. If you like mindlessly exploring virtually featureless terrain to farm useless chemicals and sell it only to rinse and repeat 10,000 times on different planets then you will like this game well enough. As for me I like a little potato with my gravy. Don't get me wrong, exploration is one of my favorite parts of gaming, but I like substance to back it up and this game just doesn't cut it (Can't wait for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild). Getting into your ship is rad, the first time I took off I went hyper speed and landed outside a solar system and into a asteroid belt. In space you can destroy objects and hostile star ships to get materials to patch your ship up or refuel.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"The game runs much cleaner in outer space than on planet as long as you don't have more than one planet rendering in frame. This is one of those games where if it renders too much in one frame the mouse input gets wavy and you turn further than warranted given your mouse stroke. The games player input response seems to rely greatly on the current frame rate which is a terrible bottleneck to write into your game. It doesnt help that the FOV is worse than n64 fps games, i feel so crambed. The server side of this game was written by genius', but I tell you the base game was written by amateurs who obviously struggled to implement gameplay. Using the amazing technology required to make this vast universe possible for a game like this is like using it on FarmVille. What a waste.\",\n",

       "  u'The one thing about No Man\\'s Sky that was slightly appealing to me was the promise that every planet l visit will be completely random and each creature and tree would look different... or at least that was what l thought, yes for the first 3 hours or so it did seem to me like it would be that way. However on my 4 planet l started noticing small similarity\\'s to the other planets l had visited previously and by about my 8 planet l couldn\\'t tell it apart. l was seeing repetition of weather systems, the fauna started looking the same and l was seeing repeats of animal parts making the creature look very similar to ones l had already seen. The problem with random generation in games is that it can become very repetitive fairly quickly because it relies on a pool of parts. For example when you land on a planet the game is going to pick hundreds of these pieces and mush them together to make random looking animals and random trees and a random planet. The problem lies with the depth of that pool of parts and the size of the universe. No Man\\'s Sky is has an infinite universe and a fairly shallow pool of parts. This means you the main aim of the game \"Exploration\" becomes very repetitive and in my opinion boring.',\n",

       "  u\"No Man's Sky (NMS) had a lot of promise, hype and speculation before its release, which sadly the game has ultimately not been able to live up to. For a game that promised 18 quintillion planets, it offered a seemingly endless amount of space to explore, experience, exploit and expand into. Unfortunately, what's on offer in the final product is a game that offers a dramatic sense of scale, coupled with an amazingly technical backbone, which ultimately doesn't put anything worth really experiencing inside of that product. As vast as the universe in No Man's Sky actually is, what you will actually get is a repetitive experience, copying mostly the same 3-4 actions across any world and with only a handful of alien races to interact with.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"To begin with, what No Man's Sky actually succeeds in is a sense of scale that's unprecedented. You really can go almost anywhere and visit anything you can see. From barren moons, to frozen wastes and then to the depths of oceanic paradise worlds - if you can see something from a planet, you can get in your ship to go there. This is by far the most amazing element of NMS and for many, it's more than enough to carry them through the experience. Every new world offers an opportunity to find new resources to mine, upgrades for your suit, ship or other systems and see potentially dangerous or fascinating creatures to scan. Once you find a system, planet, creature or formation you can name it whatever you want to upload it - essentially claiming the discovery for yourself.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"This is by far where NMS shines, but it's not long after the sheen of this aspect of the game wears thin that the flaws begin to show. For one thing, while there is a universe of endless planets out there, the actual things you do on them are very limited. Mostly, NMS repeats the same exact types of gameplay mechanics on any world you visit. The same prefab buildings exist on every world, with often the same one of three (possibly more) alien species manning a desk. Here is where one of the first artificial constraints on the interactions available in NMS begin: Outside of talking to an alien to do a three option guessing game, you really cannot do very much in these places as it disables your weapons. Sometimes you can trade or sell things, or offer to buy a visiting creatures ship if you hang around a facility with a landing pad, but otherwise that's generally the gist of things.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u'More notably, even after a handful of hours of gameplay I began to notice that many of these \"choose an option\" things are quite repetitive. It doesn\\'t take long for alien factories, facilities and similar to start repeating similar kinds of puzzles or options. This is especially important to learn, as is figuring out what an aliens language or culture is like, because if you fail these options you can miss out on important things. Alien manufacturing facilities, for example, often have blueprints to new items you can construct. If you fail to get these little dialog puzzles/guessing games right, you miss out on getting the blueprint and will need to trek to another facility to have another shot.',\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"Another thing the game encourages, but doesn't really mechanically support very well, is the bounty for scanning all the unique species on a planet. This frequently turns into a frustrating, luck based scavenger hunt and particularly if you're looking for predators (rare) or things that spawn underwater/underground (which seem especially low). Adding to the frustration, some of the mechanics designed to help you find these animals actually don't work in these underground/underwater biomes, making those rare aquatic/underground species even more difficult to locate than they otherwise should be. Simple mechanical changes to the interface and how scanning works would easily make this mechanic not feel so frustrating or time consuming.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"In fact the PC interface in NMS is quite baffling in itself. The game requires you to click and hold down the mouse to interact with objects. Likewise, you constantly have to fiddle with your inventory to do simple things, like refuel a system that has run out of power, shuffle things about and similar. It's actually quite frustrating and slows the gameplay down - which is already glacially paced - quite often. Similarly, much of the interesting part of the gameplay in exploring new planets is slowed up or halted by constantly having to fiddle with refueling different things. A large part of NMS is focused on survival light mechanics, constantly needing to keep in mind having plutonium (life support, lifting off from the surface in your ship) and Theonine9 (ship engines) to get about the place. Sometimes you can be exploring but need to wander off to find some of these to move onwards. Similarly, you cannot call your ship any time you want and if you wander far away - like when scanning for new species - the best way to get your ship is to luck out finding an outpost with a hackable beacon.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"This unfortunately leads to one of NMS bigger problems, which is the deeply unsatisfying combat. While your multitool can be upgraded and fitted for shooting, none of it ever feels satisfying or very fun. Enemies are sometimes quite infrequent, especially if your planet has no hostile predators, so you often never need to shoot much at all. Even when you do engage in combat, it's frequently non-life threatening and most sentinels are easily dealt with before they summon more - unless you get one bugged under the ground (where you can't shoot it to stop the alarm). Space pirates are by far the biggest initial threat, because if you run into them early before any major ship upgrades that can rapidly tear you to pieces. This is especially because of the clunky interface requiring you to manually add elements into your shield. Space combat is clunky and difficult, only marginally improved with ship upgrades, which at least make pirates non-life threatening whenever you run into them.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"Overall, my main complaint with NMS is ironically a content one. There is just very little to actually do or see in this universe of practically infinite planets to explore. Once you have seen a few systems and explored several planets, you have seen much of what NMS has to offer. Unless you like doing the same, entirely repetitive tasks, there really isn't actually that much game in NMS. This is disappointing, because in many ways I expected a lot more from a game that was priced at $60. Sadly, NMS has the problem where it feels like a game that could be great after some more patches and development time (It's got freighters and bases coming soon). What is released feels, with its myriad of problems, bugs and other issues, a $30 early access title with the promise of actual gameplay to come. As it is, at $60, unless you really like exploring planets filled with the same 5-6 things repeatedly, I cannot recommend No Man's Sky.\"],\n",

I did enjoy the first hours of the game but it becaoes repetative really fast. Grinding for more slots, with no storyline or real goal. This game should have had much more potential, even if they only had put in simple multiplayer aspects. Like exploring together, and being able to see other players. I rather would have had 1% of the amount of planets and variation if there would be a multiplayer aspect. Like building a base together, defending and attacking other players bases. But ofcourse a PS4 user needs a friendly enviroment and be able to pause the game, so I suspect that's why they did not put in most of the features which would have allowed for this. Like the non-existant faction system. I love Multiplayer crafting games like Ark, 7daystodie and rust. Maybe that has cloaded my expectations with all the wrong advertising even on this store page. In retrospect I would buy this game when it would have been 15 euro's. But the current price is just not justifiable due to the lack of contents and gameplay.\",\n",

The items you find are mostly the same, all planets have all resources so why travel when you can max out on your starter planet.

       "  u\"So, here we go, (there will be spoilers in this review). As a PC only gamer, I usually try to ignore articles and adverts for console games. Not because I hate consoles, but because I don't want to get sucked in to buying a console that I just can't afford. This game was one of those games, even after I heard that it was coming out on PC, I still resisted. Finally, the hype was everywhere, I couldn't not see it. I watch a video, I read some articles, you know, I tried to do my homework. It LOOKED like a fun game. A universe with all this planets to explore, strange creatures to see, ships to buy. So I bought it, paid full price as there was no one even offering a dicount. I'm 20 hours in now, I bought a big ship, I upgraded my exosuit, visited the first Atlas Base...aaaaaaand I really don't have any desire to play anymore. Oh I probably will, but not right away. I love open ended games, I've played a lot of Minecraft, and you need a goal in those types of games. The difference is, you choose your goals instead of the game choosing them for you. I'm going to build a base that looks like the Taj Mahal, or I want to produce and store tons of power etc etc. No Man's sky doesn't have that pull, that gravity. I've explored every planet in every system I've gone through, I've completely explored one planet. But the more planets I went to, the more it started to dawn on me, these planets are all the same. Sure they look different, but they are all the same. The same 6 or 7 building types are on every planet, some more or less than others. But it's a depressing thought, a universe full of the same things. I can only imagine the code behind the procedural planets and lifeforms wasn't easy to write, but it's like they did it, and then didn't check their work. I've seen buildings underwater that it's obvious they shouldn't be underwater, as there is fluid port on the outside flowing into...water.\",\n",

How you start with a basic exosuit, and to upgrade your suit you have to use inventory space to do it...you have to find places to buy new slots on a planet. This took me many systems. We are able to flit from system to system, but I have to keep feeding all of these systems that are keeping me alive, the technology doesn\\'t exist, to automatically take resources from my inventory. Shields go down during space combat? Is there even a hotkeys to automatically refill shields? Nope, better hope you don\\'t get destroyed while you go into your inventory and reload your shields. Want to fly low to the ground? Can\\'t. Want to have smooth control of flight in space? Better hope your wrists can withstand all the side scrolling you are going to be doing. You can\\'t even stop flying in space! You are either going forward or backward. If you accidently hit \"e\" while flying, no way to cancel that landing. No hovering on a planet either unless you are landing.',\n",

They've achieved that and it is amazing that they did, but the trouble is that no real game seems to have been added to this accomplishment. While it is certainly lightweight fun to explore for a couple of hours at a time, it is not worth the premium $60 in its current form. When creating a huge game-world (or worlds), there has to be some primary purpose. The world of any game is the setting alone - a platform upon which a game is built...\",\n",

There is really nothing you can do except a little light crafting of components for your exosuit and spaceship, exploring a procedurally-generated planet, logging the results for game-currency credits and flying through space systems. Although the planets vary, the range of components that are selected randomly seem a little narrow, so you will find a generic mix of \"I\\'m new at Spore\" type of fudged together animals (amphibian head, deer\\'s legs and a beak - or something like that). The creatures are really just \\'there\\'; you are limited in being able to feed them, after which they might lead you to some collectable resource, but otherwise they just exist. I haven\\'t seen any of the giant, majestic creatures shown in the trailers, and I don\\'t know if I ever will.

The wind and weather effects add a bit of improved ambience to make some planets feel a little more different but, essentially, nothing is that different after all - so you grind for more resources in order to jet off to another planet. I found myself wanting more stark differences in planets, like harsh and brutal conditions on a desolate planet, or a planet populated by an alien species who is less than welcoming.

The developers have said that anything less than a quad core CPU is not supported, nor are CPUs that don't have the SSSE.3 instruction set (like some older AMD Phenoms). While playable with mouse and keyboard, it plays a LOT better with a gamepad controller and seems to have been optimised for that. Performance-wise, disable frame-rate limits, AA and other graphics in-game and use your GPU software to set these properties instead, and you should experience smooth gameplay after around an hour of initial stutteriness (due to GPU shader caching during the early start of the game).\",\n",

This in and of itself isn't a problem, if the game would throw the occasional curve ball. Such as, here's an observatory, but one of the rooms is wrecked and covered in blood, and the people there insist that everything's fine but are acting shady.

       "  u'At around the 30ish hour mark you will find you have collected most, if not all of the tech upgrades. Shortly after this your suit, tool and ship will likely be maxxed out in terms of functionality and power. After this point, having more inventory upgrades or a bigger ship is somewhat pointless due to the fact you do not need to gather resources aside from maintaining charge on your gear and jump fuel to reach the center. The fact that after 30ish hours you will have seen most, if not all of the content available means that the subsequent time spent is simply a grind to jump to the center of the universe, which at maximum jump range will likely take 600 to 700 jumps. Assuming you stock up on materials to craft jump fuel periodically along the way this is a monumental and completely unnecessary grind. Top this off with the game as it is calculating your jump range max at around 1650 LY, but due to launch changes increasing the universe size 10x, your linear jump distance to the core only shows 10% of that jump range distance gained when you actually jump. Since I did not realize these things during my first review I must change my recommendation to DEFINITELY NOT recommended, unless you like simply exploring planets repetitively with no new content, no real purpose or goal. I may come back to review again after the development team adds the excessive amount of content they showed in previews for the game prior to release but cut out of the game without informing the players before launch.',\n",

It\\'s the fact that many amazing features promised over the course of it\\'s development cycle are missing or have even been scrapped from the game. The mysticism and beauty of the planets shown in the promotional material is completely void within the game. Every planet is a simple rock, and I\\'m sorry but I feel no want to explore something as barren and bland as a rock. Yes, I understand that not all planets should be Earth-like. But that doesn\\'t mean 99% of them should be barren. What happened to the cool sand planets and hopefully different types of planets we were promised? I want to fight giant sand worms, fly with giant space whales over crazy and interesting rock formations. But sadly the planets here don\\'t provide that. Space battles and factions be damned if the game just had actually interesting planets to explore. But sadly that just isn\\'t the case. And even if that were the case, you\\'d most likely be spending most of your time managing your inventory and trying to figure out how to best manuever the UI instead of taking in the sights. And the RPG elements? Don\\'t even bother, your choices don\\'t matter. Apperantly after making a stupid decision because I couldn\\'t understand one of the aliens. I was forced to marry one of their kind. I thought \"Holy \\u2665\\u2665\\u2665\\u2665, what\\'s going to happen.\" The answer? Nothing, nothing \\u2665\\u2665\\u2665\\u2665ing happened. That alien never showed up and never will, showing me that all the decisions are nothing but a simple way of figuring out whether you get a reward or you don\\'t. Then I decided to try some piracy, if I couldn\\'t have fun being the good peaceful guy, why not try to be a villian for once. Nope, the combat is so bad not only was I shot down in seconds, but I could barely maneuver my ship correctly to even get shots off on the enemy. Then I had to frolic through the terrible UI and Inventory system trying to repair my shields only to find that I died because it\\'s a stupid idea to have it so that to recharge your shields YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR DAMN INVENTORY! Don\\'t buy this game, wait a few months. Hopefully then those features promised to us will be in the game and I can actually do the exploring and adventuring that I\\'ve always wanted to do in a SCI-FI universe. I cannot and will not recommend the game in it\\'s current state. Wait, just wait. All we can hope for now is that the game\\'s cut content will be given to us in free updates instead of being forced into payed DLC. IF it becomes payed DLC, then this game will forever be a dead galaxy filled with barren rocks, and static cardboard pieces that are the aliens and animals. If you\\'ve read this far, thanks.

It's alot of the exact same. Honestly this game is worth maybe a third of what it currently costs and even then, I wouldn't play it unless you're really into this kind of stuff.\"],\n",

       "  u\"No Man's Sky is getting mixed reviews because its not the game that everyone was expecting. It does a fairly decent job of being an open world, sci-fi survival/ exploration game (even though there are other games that accomplish that style much better). I also feel like most of the hate its receving isnt 100% deserved, as the developers were extreamly vauge in their description of the game, gamers were left to fill in the blanks which led to massive speculation. People thought this game would be so much more than what they showed, when in reality it was exactly that and nothing more. This game is great for people who have a lot of time on their hands and thoroughly enjoy other games such as Minecraft or StarBound. However, if you are looking for a sci-fi, space combat sim or a linear storly line with deep amounts of lore than i'd suggest looking elsewhere. At it's very core, No Man's Sky is a not-so-simple tech demo that was trying to be a full, $60, AAA game. This game will be extreamly enjoyable for a select group of gamers, but for everyone else, it will be just another hype-train derailed.\"],\n",

I really wanted to say something nice about the game, and was hoping that it could at least deliver the same amount of fun I had playing freelancer back in 2000.

Animals on different planets look the same, buildings are identical on all planets, the flora are identical apart from the colours, all alien species act the same, ships are simply cosmetic differences with inventory slots. Variety is limited. Mining becomes too tedious. And even then, I was willing to push on, grind it out for hours to see whether there was more down the line.

First off the repetitive nature of the game, just hopping from planet to planet and exploring all animal species and going to all the sites on a planet evantually loses its novelty. To make matters worse all these activities are easy and there are no other ways to approach things differently. Now doing repetitive things have become pretty commen in games, hell I personally hate dealing with games from ubisoft for this exact reason. But even in a procedural generate universe it should have been possible to have missions, or have some other threats to deal with. I have not made it to the center yet, but if a game is advertised as exploration then some variety is needed, because as it stands now once you have got all your milestones made it to the center then there really is not much more to do and thus making all those countless planets obsolete.',\n",

Not being able to stop your ship, A and D keys to roll your ship. Oke maybe thats because I love the Elite:Dangerous controls but it just feels wrong. The feeling that my mouse is on ice when trying to aim at something it feels very slipery.

However I do feel its to late for alot of people, alot of gamers will have put it beside them and move on never looking back at it again.

But, I think the the problem I'm having with No Man's Sky, is that it's just repetetive, tedious, and kinda boring. Don't get me wrong, the concept is amazing and everything, and the planets are beautiful. It's just, you do the same thing on every planet, with no real differences, and you repeat this, for like, forever. The creatures are cool. Except how that they're all basically the same, with just different looks, none of them do anything special or extravagant. The scale of everything is just amazing, but it's yet another downfall. It takes like six minutes to walk from one place to another, only to find that nothing about the base you found is different from one on another planet. The game was also probably a little over-hyped, so it's a little bit of our own fault for expecting too much. It seems that the developers plan to update it and add new things, so maybe, hopefully, at some point this game will become the game that we all thought it to be.\"],\n",

       "  u'After having bought this game 2 months prior to the initial release date only for it to be delayed for even more time I was SURE that this game was going to be (for the most part) everything it was said to be. That being a MASSIVE dynamic space exploration game with a beautiful art style. Since 2012 all the hype about the game has really gotten to me honestly but I tried to hold back because it had \"bad game\" written all over it. This was a AAA title being devoloped by a indie studio with no alpha or beta tests, no huge history to the company, and with a team of about 15 people. I kinda just shoved all those thoughst into the back of my head and bought the pre-order on Steam.',\n",

       "  u'Now for the reason I believe this game is a bad purchase (For $60). I REALLY want to love the game, I honestly do. However, when I first pressed install in my library I Immediatly knew that something was wrong. 2.5 gigs? A game this vast and interesting in the size of my pictures folder? Okay.. I understand that most of the game is generated and does not need very much space so I, again, brushed that part off.',\n",

Every 2-3 seconds the game would freeze for about 1 second and come back, sometimes this'd go away for a few minutes and sometimes it was extremely frequent.\",\n",

       "  u\"Stuttering was something I could live with and i'm sure that issue can be resolved with a little bit of tweaking in the config files.

On the general discussion page for NMS i made a thread \"Is No Man\\'s Sky really 1080p?\" and most of the people the respond all had the same thought proccess. The game runs at 1920 x 1080, but renders itself at 720p. A AAA title running at 720p on PC? Come on.',\n",

       "  u\"NVIDIA has a thing to fix this, DSR. Using DSR i was able to make the game run at an upscaled 4k, then down to 1080p to make it look proper. However doing this means i'm essentially running 4 instances of the game and make my gpu buckle.\",\n",

       "  u'Okay.. fine lets just run the stuttery 720p mode this game apparently wants me to run. Surely with the low resolution my FPS will be great! Right?.. Wrong. With one of todays highest end graphics cards (GTX 1080 FTW) i get about 70 FPS on medium-max settings without super sampling. You might be saying \"70 FPS is fine, 60 FPS is all you need\", I run a 144hz monitor and 70 FPS is very very very noticable on screen. With the FPS being half my refresh rate, it makes the mouse movement extremely laggy and almost impossible to play with.',\n",

It's very redundant and boring. The vegetation is around the same density and size all around so it's pretty boring to see past the first few, the wildlife (while it is diverse) don't really do much other than walk around. Yes I know there are mechanics of the game I did not discover but quite frankly after trouble shooting the game for 20-30 minutes and playing it for another hour and a half I realised..

Honestly I'm surprised this game worked at all with the small team that built it. So hats off to them for building something like this. But ultimately this game is just unplayable. I mean in a sense that after the initial fascination it just becomes repetitive and boring. I played a couple hours and after 4 crashes just started screwing around with a trainer and did what ever I wanted because at that point anything I did was just crashing and lost so whatever. So I think I'm done with this game. If this studio brings their horizons into focus maybe they'll have an amazing game in the future. But right now. No.\"],\n",

       "  u'To be totally honest i have been soooo hyped about this game that i paid my 60 \\u20ac in a heartbeat as soon as i could afford them. And the first 12 hours were amazing...but after a while it started to be a bit repetitive. The \"different\" planets kinda looked the same...with the same kind of resources that needed mining. In the end it started to be like a minecraft with the only purpose of mining and selling what i mine for upgrades and a bigger,better looking chest. And all that is fine, but it\\'s not sth for 60 euros...especially if monecraft,with all the building and redstonz possibilities, and the graphics of wolfenstein 3d is about 20\\u20ac. So i feel that the dev\\'s should look into sth like building and creating stuff or maybe a inter alien war or conflict in which we can choose sides and i don\\'t know go through blocades to access a planet...i mean the trade ships are there with the autoturrets...sooo it could be possible to create that. Furthermore a small planetary attack on the HQ with some RL friends (to whom we can maybe set a waypoint to and travel there?). The possibilites and opportunities with this game are endless and it would be nice...and just for the dev\\'s to at least try and implement these kind of changes for free for people who paid more that enough for this game.'],\n",

Every seam and cut corner begins to show, and they add up to kill the player's enthusiasm about exploring new worlds or making contact with the game's alien races. Nothing brings this static, rote nature into focus like Nada and Polo -- the only time I can recall seeing more than one alien in a given location -- can't even have a conversation with one another.

       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"The first thing that hit me before even launching the game was the fact that for a game with billions or trillions of randomly generated worlds it's got only about 2,5 GB of assets ? Unfortunately the limitations are apparent and just after a couple of hours or maybe even sooner repetitions are rampant... It's clearly the amount of assets at fault, maybe the ran out of time or funds or whatever but it's WAY too little for such a huge game.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"They definitely should've made the ground bases you find along the way more modular and bigger, so there's something to actually explore and so they're not the exact copy every single time. Same with fauna and intelligent aliens. From what I've seen they're usually just varied by some horn here or there some different limb and stuff like that. Why they didn't go for amorphous or slithering aliens. How about quadruped intelligent aliens ( maybe they are a possibillity, I haven't met any yet tho ). The possibilities are endless if only the assets weren't so limited. The game needs to be more diverse, add different shapes to the structures ( so far I've only seen 1 kind of spacestation ) add some explorable ruins and add more choices to dialogue options that matter and more interesting riddles.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"The foundations are there and here comes some hope for the future, if all that's needed is a bigger pool of assets there's a high chance they might expand on it in the future right? RIGHT? I'd love to think so as this game certainly got potential. It will never match it's hype that's obvious but there's still some fun to be had once we eliminate the technical problems and expand the randomness of the universe.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"Oh also need to add a little about the combat and flight mechanics. The weapon selection is awfully uninspired. Pretty much everything boils down to beam and pulse weapon with the addition of grenades on the ground. Weapons do get some modification like a shotgun mod for the ground pulse weapon but nothing too drastic so far. Where are missiles, torpedos and other projectile weapons? Not in NMS for sure... Eh and let's not forget about one of my biggest gripes with the game and that's the flight mechanics. Unresponsive and restricting, you can't hit the ground with your ship there's an invisible pushing you away and turning your ship. Takes away a lot from the enjoyment of flight. One last thing, cockpits, all the ships look pretty much the same inside and there's nearly none ( if any at all ? ) feedback from inside the ship.\",\n",

       "  u\"Great walking simulator. What a step backwards in the genre. The only thing that No Man's Sky does really well is give you a bit of a feeling of wonder as you mindlessly collect materials, either transfer them to your ship or sell them, maybe upgrade or craft a few things and do it again. Even in areas where you would expect to see life, like busy space stations, they are still lifeless and extremely dull. Multiplayer or not, at least add some more NPCs to places that are going to be busy like stations and outposts to show SOME life besides the one occassional alien who is also completely isolated at a trading post. There's really no excuse for 20 ships to enter a station with several ships also circling around it and the player doesn't see anyone ever come out of a ship or the ship even do anything upon landing. There are overall better games than No Man's Sky in the same genre with and without the sci-fi aspect. Subnautica, GRAV, The Long Dark, Starbound and Elite Dangerous to name a few and even Firewatch comes off as a more interesting walking simulator. Overhyped to \\u2665\\u2665\\u2665\\u2665 with dull gameplay. Maybe buy it when it's on sale if you're still really curious but you aren't missing much.\"],\n",

I have had very few issues running the game, a minor amount of lag from time to time, my issues stem from little things. Running is soooooo slow. Landing is a pain in the butt, it would be nice to be able to land close to the waypoint but difficult to do in the game, you either undershoot or overshoot and have to walk to the waypoint which takes forever. I like the procedurally generated worlds. I don\\'t like that it\\'s ten species on every planet for you to identify- wouldn\\'t there be some planets with only one species, and some planets with 30 species? The \\'milestones\\' notifications should be trimmed down to a little popup in the lower corner of the screen. I\\'m going to keep playing and exploring - the game can be fun if you are patient.

It\\'s like instead of using actual artists for the game they just got a random color-generator to paint the planets and called it done. For example I got \"moldy pizza planet\" with puke orange and green splotches, and \"boring rock planet\" which is just a plain brown planet with only a few mining sources on it. I know I know, so many planets and galaxies, countless possibilities right? But even the wildlife is horrible. I squee\\'d at the idea of feeding the local fauna until I realised what a bad choice it was. Not only are the creatures badly pieced together by spare animal parts, they are also poorly rigged and will flop over themselves trying to run away from you. And if you do manage to track the thing down and feed it, it responds with some ear-splitting cries like it\\'s being burned alive.

       "  u'Was a great game in the begining, but after 4 hours you have seen everything. The planets arent really diverse and the stations on the planets are copied and pasted. The whole idea with the inventory and crafting is a mess, you have limited inventory and ship slots. If you craft an upgrade for your suit it takes a inventory slot, but you can get more suit inventory slots through drop pod (which look all the same again). The thing these is that they cost 10.000 Units more per upgrade, so you get your first new slot for free, the next for 10.000, then 20.000 and so on. The ship slots are even worse, you only get more slots through a new ship, since the upgrades you built for your ship are not movable you loose them when you buy or find a new one. Which leads me on to crafting, cause crafting is all about grinding. Everything you use needs ressources, so your exo-suit needs ressources and your mining laser and so on. So you land on a planet and head out to mine the ressources you need for your ship, suit and mining laser. If you want to upgrade something you have to grind even more, cause the high-level upgrades need a lot of ressources and most of them arent on your planet, so you fly arounf in the galaxy just to grind some more. Thats basicly all you do in this game.'],\n",

Just show a badge on screen and don't break immersion. Tips and dialogs show the default key not whatever you changed it to.

Stamina is really limited but although you can increase it theres no point. Its almost impossble to run for any useful length of time as any time the terrain drops over 4mm you'll stop sprinting (which requires 2 button presses). Menus are a complete mess. The mouse cursor resets position when changing between inventories or pages of a list. Some interactions require a click, others require you to hold the button down while the cursor animates a circle once (or twice sometimes).

The sentinel ship glitch is by far the worst, if you activate the warp drive to escape persuing ships and they see you, you better hope you can exit immidiately, because if you re-organize your inventory then exit, you have to either reset or fly all the way back to wherever you were last seen.

It is a treat to fly to one of the mile-long freighters and skim the surface of its hull. Too bad you cannot do that with a planet\\u2019s terrain. Roughly fifty meters above the surface, the game forbids you from descending or pitching the nose of your ship down. The only way to go lower is to land.

Wait several seconds for the buy and sell choices appear (you can\\u2019t do both in the same menu). Want to craft something in your inventory? Simple: pick an empty slot, click-and-hold, click-and-hold on the desired product. Want to upgrade your suit, ship, or multitool?

I wish I wasn't so naive as to waste 40 hours of my life on this steaming pile of \\u2665\\u2665\\u2665\\u2665. I feel very very bad for the friend of mine that gifted this to me as a reward for helping him build his PC. I also feel very bad for anybody that paid $60 for this. Despite me feeling like this I will say that I will keep my eye out for patches that will maybe come out that will add the experience that we were all promised by Sean Murray, and I recommend anybody who hasn't gotten it to do the same and by the time those happen chances are you'll only have to pay $30 for the game, and if not, then leave this ship to sink. Just please, anybody who hasn't wasted their money on this yet, I beg of you, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET. This game is a prime example of why I'm probably going to stop putting my money into the gaming industry soon... It's no longer about having fun and delivering the product you advertised, it's about squeezing as much money out of a costumer base as you can... it's become a business instead of getting home from a hard day in the world and just having a good sit down and take your mind off of life for a couple hours and have some good, cheap, reliable and easy fun. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep because of my realization that promised perfection is almost always never gonna be lived up to in this market.\"],\n",

Which'll sometimes produce really interesting planets sure, but for the most part will be pretty uninteresting and bland looking landscapes occupied by animals that for the most part look very similar planet to planet.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"Why're you paying for that alone? Because gameplay and story are pretty much non existent. Space combat is a joke: The sole tactic is holding down left click while looking vaguely in the direction of your enemy, then continually tabbing into your inventory mid fight to charge your shields. It presents no challenge whatsoever after a few upgrades, and pirate interceptions quickly become tedious rather than exciting. Flying around a planet is SOOO bad! You can't stop and hover, you can't actually land the ship yourself, and get this - you can't actually crash your ship. It has this bloody terrible system where if you angle the nose at the planet, you auto hover back up. This means you can't actually fly low, zipping between canyons or performing any type of low altitude maneuver. It feels rubbish.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"Actual combat isn't great either, as for one thing you can just instantly drop aggro by going inside a building, and although I know you can get high security planets, in my 24 hours play I haven't felt threatened yet.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"Furthermore, while both guns and ships are procedurally generated (which can produce some cool looking results), they behave exactly the same! The trader ship, explorer and fighter shoot and handle identically, you could have a large trading ship with only 20 inventory slots, or a tiny fighter with 40. It's the same story for multitools, they're all identical in feel, the only difference as far as I'm aware is the inventory slots. Also, there are very few upgrades for both ships and multitools so there's not much room to customise.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"The inventory and UI looks like they just ported the system from ps4 as whenever you select things you need to wait for a loading circle rather than just clicking. To me, navigating menus in No Man's Sky just feels clunky and slow. Crafting is also weak IMO. Not very many interesting recipes or things to do, definitely not for example on the same level of breadth as Minecraft, although admittedly they aren't the same type of game so maybe that comparison is unfair.\",\n",
       "  u'',\n",
       "  u\"Graphics for the most part are very meh. Asteroids in space and any objects on the planet excluding structures will draw very close, so as you're travelling around they will pop up, sometimes right in front of you. The textures themselves are pretty low too. Occasionally you will find a place that genuinely does look quite beautiful but these are so few and far between it doesn't seem worth the time.\",\n",

       "  u\"'Oh but my 18 quintillion planets and discovering things for the first time!' Surely this makes up for the failings I've listed above?

Doesn't mean it's good.\",\n",

Sure you discover and explore, but it feels so useless, so unimportant and all you get is a message 'you discovered your 94th boring planet no one will ever see'. And then onto the next planet. The reason I say that's all you get is because it doesn't feel like you're connected to a living, breathing universe, with people making discoveries and uploading them for everyone to see. It basically feels single player, which made me question the f*** I was even uploading anything for.\",\n",

Oh and also a terrible, and I mean terrible map with almost no functionality, no way of actually looking up a place you want to go, or even see the route you've taken (Surely this is the most basic thing for a game about journeying to the centre of the galaxy from the outskirts)\",\n",

You'll meet a single stationary NPC in a generic building you've seen a thousand times, have a short conversation, the result of which is almost always a blueprint for something you already know, or maybe a chance for a free multitool upgrade. That's basically it. There's a reputation system with these different species, but it is laughably far apart from the picture of complex galactic politics that Sean Murray tried to paint. I found that after 3 hours I was pretty much at the highest diplomatic status for one of them, and from then it never went down, no matter what I did. Not that it really mattered anyway, as the reputation status seemed nothing more than an arbitrary value which has so far had no lasting consequences whatsoever.\",\n",

I think overall Hello Games have behaved unethically, hyping people up and fanning the flames of this hypeness to an extent they knwe to be unrealistic, in order to boost sales.
