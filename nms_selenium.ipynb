People kept saying things like this:\\n\\n\"Planets get more interesting closer to the center.\"\\n\"You just haven\\'t given the game enough time yet. It gets better once you get more inventory slots.\"\\n\"Keep playing, I\\'ve had an amazing time.\"\\n\\nLets say someone came to me and said \"Lets dig to the center of the Earth. Theres a pot of gold there and you will be rich. Heres a shovel\", and I start digging. After 10 hours I say \"This sucks. I\\'m going back up the ladder.\"\\n\\nThe gentleman says \"No keep digging. It will get better. It will be worth it.\"\\n\\nAfter 23 hours of digging I\\'m still having a terrible time. Do I give up and say \"that was no fun\", or do I keep digging?\\n\\nHow about if I had paid 40 quid for the shovel?\\n\\nedit: I wrote this review immediately after closing the game and saw \"23 hours\" - Steam updated a few mins later to add the last few hours I\\'d spent playing.
