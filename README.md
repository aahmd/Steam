# Steam

Adam Ahmed & Alex Marr

Analyzing the reviews that players gave various games on the Steam platform.  Please see the 'abstract' notebook for more details.  Note that this is a side-project we'll be updating periodically as we are not competely sure the directrion we would like to take.

In the intial phase, we will focus on buidling a scraper that will return ALL reviews for a given game(s) in order to leverage the size of the data (CounterStrike:GlobalOffensive has ~1.3M reviews; we aren't interested in just the first few thousand reviews).

After the inital mining, we'll take a detailed look at the reviews using libraries such as NLTK and/or Spacy.
