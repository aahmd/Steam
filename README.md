###Analyzing Game reviews on Steam


The Steam Store is a great source of user-generated reviews.  For example, the game CounterStrike: Global Offensive has accumulated ~1.3M reviews over the years.  While some range from the comment 'get rekt' others are more useful, and have lengthy evaluations of the games from, in many cases, experienced players that are arguably well-suited to do so.

In the intial phase, we will focus on buidling a scraper that will return ALL reviews for a given game(s), in order to leverage the size of the data.  After mining, and some likely substanial data cleaning, the next steps will involve Natural Langugage Processiing (NLP). 

###Some questions we may be able to answer:

        1  What is the reaction to a new games release?
        2  What is the reaction to a patch or update to an existing game?
        3  What games are correlated?  Which aren't?  How about characters within games?
        4  After reading a users review, which other(s) game may they enjoy?
        5  What 'types' of games are trending currently? Are some types becoming more/less popular?
        

###Final notes

This repo will be a 'work in progress' and we'll have some files that are not fully complete or more of a 'sandbox' file where we are trying new libraries, etc.
